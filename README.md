# node-chat-app

This is a simple app that I made while following along with the course The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition) on Udemy. It is an app that uses Socket.IO to allow for real-time chatting between users. Users can set their display name and type in the room they wish to join. They can then chat in real time with users in the same room.
